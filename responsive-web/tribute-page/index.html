        <p id="about">Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist best known for inventing the World Wide Web. Born on June 8, 1955, in London, England, Berners-Lee has made a profound impact on the modern world by developing the foundational technologies that enable the existence of the web as we know it today.</p>
        <p>He invented the worldwide-web <a id="tribute-link" href="https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web" target="_blank">while working at CERN</a> in the 1980s.

        <h3>Key Contributions and Technologies</h3>
        <p>Berners-Lee's invention of the web was based on three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today's web:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The standard markup language used to create web pages.</li>
          <li><strong>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):</strong> A string of characters used to identify a resource on the web. The most common form of URI is the web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</li>
          <li><strong>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):</strong> The protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Berners-Lee has received numerous awards and honors for his invention, including the Turing Award, sometimes referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.</p>
